## General Torrent
**Some of these sites have Fake and Mirror sites, you should only use the ones we link to.**

**[1337x.to](https://1337x.to) | [.st](https://1337x.st/) | [.gd](https://1337x.gd/) | [.eu](https://x1337x.eu/) (Torrent)**

A very popular Torrenting site which has an incredible amount of content, but also has major downsides including insufficient moderation in general (not banning uploaders who have uploaded Malware in the past) and an *incredibly* unsafe Software category.  
**NOTE: Do not get Software Releases from this site.  
Stay away from Torrents by [IGGGAMES](https://1337x.to/user/IGGGAMESCOM/), [xGIROx](https://1337x.to/user/xGIROx/), Seyter, Qoob, nosTEAM and CorePack.**  

**[RARBG](https://rarbg.to) (Torrent)**

A very safe site to get Games from, mostly Scene Releases which they have Auto Uploading Bots for. If you use a VPN get ready to solve reCAPTCHAs.  
<sub>psst. check the [misc](https://ripped.guide/Utilities/misc/#:~:text=reCAPTCHA%20Solver%20%26%20hCaptcha%20Solver%20%2D%20Automatically%20solves%20reCAPTCHAs%20and%20hCaptchas%20on%20websites%2C%20no%20user%20interaction%20required.) page for captcha bypasses.</sub>

**[RuTor](http://rutor.info) (Torrent)**

An old Russian tracker that has plenty of content but with generally less seeders. Some Repackers upload exclusively here.  
**NOTE: Only get Games from R.G. Mechanics, Chovka, XATAB and FitGirl**.

## Repackers

**[FitGirl](https://fitgirl-repacks.site) (Torrent / DDL)**

One of the most well known and reputable Repacker out there, very active and provides Torrent links with DDL mirrors. Only downside being the Repacks can take a long time to install depending on your hardware. Mostly Uploads on 1337x, RuTor, Tapocheck and some DDL mirrors that are linked on her site.

**[DODI](https://dodi-repacks.site) (Torrent / DDL)**

Another active Repacker that provides Torrent links with DDL mirrors. Usually takes less time to install compared to FitGirl, while having ever so slightly larger Releases. Other than DDL Mirrors on his site, he Uploads on 1337x.

**[Masquerade](https://masquerade.site) (DDL / Torrent)**

A known Repacker that focuses more on Indie titles. Mostly uses Google Drive as the main downloading option and Torrents on his newer Releases.

**[XATAB](https://xatab-repack.com) (Torrent)**

One of the oldest and most respected Repacker that passed away recently. His site is currently being used by different Repackers but his old Releases can still be found there.  
**RIP 196X - 2021.**

## General DDL

**[Ova Games](https://ovagames.com) (DDL)**

A site which focuses on re-uploading Repacks, P2P Cracks, Scene Releases and GOG Rips to various hosts. Rarely includes Torrent links. Takes requests.

**[Scene CrackHub](https://scene.crackhub.site) (DDL)**

An Automatic Scene Uploading Bot which Uploads Windows, Linux, Mac, Nintendo Switch and PS4 Scene Releases directly from [TorrentSeeds](https://torrentseeds.org/) to zippyshare.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CrackHub](https://crackhub.site) - Mainly focuses on re-uploading various content to different hosts, takes requests too.

**[GamesDrive](https://gamesdrive.net) (DDL)**

Another site that re-uploads Repacks, P2P Cracks and Scene Releases to various hosts. They also take requests.

## Forums

**[CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum) (DDL)**

Arguably the best site for Steam Piracy. It's a well moderated Forum with active members. Not only good for getting Games from, but also learning about different Cracking tools and resources for Steam Games. **_Requires Sign-up_**.

**[Torrminatorr](https://forum.torrminatorr.com) (DDL)**

Another well moderated Forum with active Uploaders and discussions that allow Scene Uploads (contrary of CS.RIN.RU), GOG Rips, Retro Games and even Linux Games. **_Requires Sign-up_**.

## Misc

**[Online-Fix](https://online-fix.me) (DDL / Torrent)**

Any Cracked Game that has Multiplayer unlocked (usually on Steam) you will most likely find it here done by their own internal Crackers (0xdeadc0de and others). **_Requires Sign-up_**.

**[GOG Games](https://gog-games.com) (DDL)**

Every GOG DRM-free Game, ripped and re-uploaded on Mirrors. Every installer is untouched and has a cryptographic SHA-265 key from GOG.

F95zone is a Forum with various Tools, Translation & Game Request channels, many English **_Porn Games_** and even English translated foreign Games such as **_Japanese Eroges_** (a searchable index can be found [here](https://f95zone.to/sam/latest_alpha/)). U18-Chan instead has exclusively **_Yiff Games_**. **_They both require you to Sign-up_**.

**[Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/?c=6_0) & [Sukebei](https://sukebei.nyaa.si/?c=1_3) (Torrent)**

Both are good sources for Visual Novels and Japanese Games while the latter is exclusively for **_NSFW titles_**.

# Tools
**All the tools listed here are Windows only unless stated otherwise.**  
<sub>All DLC unlocker tools require the actual DLC files to work, to find the DLC files: find the Game topic in [CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum) and check the first post for links to the DLC files. If there are none, then use the searchbar to search for the DLC files within the thread or just pirate the entire Game and extract the DLCs.</sub>

[**Koalageddon**](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=112021) - An incredibly easy to use DLC unlocker for Steam, Epic Games, Origin, EA Desktop & Uplay (R1 only) for legitimately owned Games. Family Sharing restrictions can also be bypassed. It can also work with Games that have Anti-Cheat such as EAC and VAC, though it is inadvisable to do so (even though there have been no confirmed cases of bans).  

[**CreamAPI**](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=70576) - Tool that can unlock all DLCs on legitimately owned Steam Games, may not work well if the Game has Anti-Cheat. [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWenVCEfxhs5gvOUj5G_fefO_B6t-B33M6nbuYJsSTg).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[creamapi-db](https://creamapidb.herokuapp.com/) - A database site that generates CreamAPI configuration files quickly.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CreamInstaller](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=117227) - Automatically finds all installed Steam/Epic Games and provides a neat GUI to automatically configure and apply CreamAPI/ScreamAPI.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Auto-CreamAPI 2](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=102173) - A tool that makes it quicker to setup CreamAPI by automating some processes.  
[**EA DLC Unlocker v2**](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=104412) - Tool that can unlock all DLCs on legitimately owned Origin/EA Games.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Origin DLC Unlocker v1](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2085788#p2085788) - An older but still maintained version that has support for **Mac** users.  
[**Uplay R1 Unlocker**](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=112169) - Ubisoft DLC unlocker, will only work for Games released before October 2020 (that have the uplay_r1\*.dll file).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Uplay R2 Unlocker](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=111874) - Same as R1 Unlocker, but instead will only work for Games released after October 2020 (that have the upc_r2\*.dll/uplay_r2\*.dll file).  
[**DreamAPI**](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=111520) - An easy to use Tool that can unlock all DLCs on legitimately owned Epic and Origin/EA Games, this can bypass Anti-Cheat software unlike ScreamAPI.

They also allow playing some Multiplayer Games on LAN with friends and unlock DLCs. Goldberg supports **Linux** unlike SSE, it is more beginner friendly and easier to use but lacks some features SSE has, such as; Bypassing SteamStub DRM, tracking and unlocking Achievements, a pre-packaged Game Launcher that makes it easier to manage Games and configure them, a more advanced Steam Overlay and support for Plugins.  
**NOTE: SSE is abandoned. If you're having issues with it, use [SSE Reborn Client [v1.46.1]](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2009102#p2009102).**

> **DDL:** Direct Download, where you can download a file from a server usually done through your Browser.    

> &nbsp;
  
> **Torrent:** A decentralised Peer-to-Peer file sharing protocol that is very common when sharing Pirated Content, since the file isnt on a single server that can easily be taken down. We recommend using [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) as a BitTorrent client.   

> &nbsp;

> **Repacks:** Highly Compressed Games that usually include all released DLCs, language packs, are Pre-Cracked and require minimal Piracy knowledge. Good for beginners and people that have limited Internet bandwidth.

> &nbsp;

> **Mirrors:** An alternate download link for the same file, similar to a DDL, but hosted in different places. If one mirror goes down, you can download the file from another mirror.
